# NovAMPP

NovAMPP (Nova's Apache2, MySQL, PHP and Perl server) is a dockerised alternative to already existing web server managers on Windows, Linux and macOS.  
This project is a direct response to issues that my high school has related to said alternative software by running in Docker, having a streamlined installer, and being easy for anyone who wants to start developing websites without being bombarded with unnecessarily complex GUIs.
